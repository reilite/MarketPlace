# Market Place
This application has been developed to aid sellers of raw goods in effectively marketing their products at competitive prices, while also facilitating factory vendors in procuring these goods at appropriate prices.

## Problem Statement
Inefficient methods of connecting raw goods sellers with factory vendors are hindering transactions and market access, causing missed opportunities. The lack of a dedicated platform creates communication barriers, pricing inconsistencies, and logistical issues. By introducing a centralized platform, these challenges can be resolved, optimizing the supply chain, improving market visibility, and enabling mutually beneficial transactions.
